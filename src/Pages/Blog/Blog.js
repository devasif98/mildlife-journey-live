                Difference between sql and nosql
              </h1>
              <p className="pb-3">
                SQL is the programming language used to interface with
                relational databases. (Relational databases model data as
                records in rows and tables with logical links between them).
                NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally
                do not use SQL.
              </p>

              <div>
                <li>
                  SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases
                  (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as
                  non-relational or distributed database. <br /> <br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  SQL databases defines and manipulates data based structured
                  query language (SQL). Seeing from a side this language is
                  extremely powerful. SQL is one of the most versatile and
                  widely-used options available which makes it a safe choice
                  especially for great complex queries. But from other side it
                  can be restrictive. SQL requires you to use predefined schemas
                  to determine the structure of your data before you work with
                  it. Also all of your data must follow the same structure. This
                  can require significant up-front preparation which means that
                  a change in the structure would be both difficult and
                  disruptive to your whole system. A NoSQL database has dynamic
                  schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways
                  which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented,
                  graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store. This flexibility
                  means that documents can be created without having defined
                  structure first. Also each document can have its own unique
                  structure. The syntax varies from database to database, and
                  you can add fields as you go. <br /> <br />
                </li>
                <li>
                  In almost all situations SQL databases are vertically
                  scalable. This means that you can increase the load on a
                  single server by increasing things like RAM, CPU or SSD. But
                  on the other hand NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
                  This means that you handle more traffic by sharding, or adding
                  more servers in your NoSQL database. It is similar to adding
                  more floors to the same building versus adding more buildings
                  to the neighborhood. Thus NoSQL can ultimately become larger
                  and more powerful, making these databases the preferred choice
                  for large or ever-changing data sets.
                </li>{" "}
                <br /> <br />
                <li>
                  SQL databases are table-based on the other hand NoSQL
                  databases are either key-value pairs, document-based, graph
                  databases or wide-column stores. This makes relational SQL
                  databases a better option for applications that require
                  multi-row transactions such as an accounting system or for
                  legacy systems that were built for a relational structure.{" "}

                  Great support is available for all SQL database from their
                  vendors. Also a lot of independent consultations are there who
                  can help you with SQL database for a very large scale
                  deployments but for some NoSQL database you still have to rely
                  on community support and only limited outside experts are
                  available for setting up and deploying your large scale NoSQL
                  deployments.

              <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold pb-3">What is JWT?</h1>
              <p className="pb-3">
                JSON Web Token is a proposed Internet standard for creating data
                with optional signature and/or optional encryption whose payload
                holds JSON that asserts some number of claims. The tokens are
                signed either using a private secret or a public/private key.
              </p>

              <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold pb-3">How does JWT work?</h1>
              <p className="pb-3">
                JWTs differ from other web tokens in that they contain a set of
                claims. Claims are used to transmit information between two
                parties. What these claims are depends on the use case at hand.
                For example, a claim may assert who issued the token, how long
                it is valid for, or what permissions the client has been
                granted. <br /> <br />
                A JWT is a string made up of three parts, separated by dots (.),
                and serialized using base64. In the most common serialization
                format, compact serialization, the JWT looks something like
                this: xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz. <br /> <br />
                <span className="text-lg font-bold">
                  Once decoded, you will get two JSON strings:
                </span>
                <li>
                  The <span className="font-bold">header</span> and the{" "}
                  <span className="font-bold">payload</span>.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <span className="font-bold">signature</span>.
                </li>{" "}
                <br />
                The JOSE (JSON Object Signing and Encryption) header contains
                the type of token — JWT in this case — and the signing
                algorithm. The payload contains the claims. This is displayed as
                a JSON string, usually containing no more than a dozen fields to
                keep the JWT compact. This information is typically used by the
                server to verify that the user has permission to perform the
                action they are requesting. There are no mandatory claims for a
                JWT, but overlaying standards may make claims mandatory. For
                example, when using JWT as bearer access token under OAuth2.0,
                iss, sub, aud, and exp must be present. some are more common
                than others. The signature ensures that the token hasn’t been
                altered. The party that creates the JWT signs the header and
                payload with a secret that is known to both the issuer and
                receiver, or with a private key known only to the sender. When
                the token is used, the receiving party verifies that the header
                and payload match the signature.

                How does NodeJS handle multiple requests at the same time?

                Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript
                runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and
                executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was
                designed to build scalable network applications. NodeJS receives
                multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS
                is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS
                has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives
                requests and processes them. NodeJS receives multiple client

                If NodeJS can process the request without I/O blocking then the
                event loop would itself process the request and sends the
                response back to the client by itself. But, it is possible to
                process multiple requests parallelly using the NodeJS cluster
                module or worker_threads module.

                Honest and have a very good manner. I spend my time to work on
                development because it's my passion I like fruit, ice-cream and
                my most favorite biryiaani and like to play Chess.

            Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train, boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and can be one way or round trip.[1] Travel can also include relatively short stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism.
